Linux:

You may see an error saying: ptrace: Operation not permitted. This is due to GDB needing elevated permissions in order to attach to a process. This can be solved using the solutions below:
When using attach to process, you need to provide your password before the debugging session can begin.

To disable this error temporarily, use the following command:

echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

To remove the error permanently, add a file called 10-ptrace.conf to /etc/sysctl.d/ and add the following kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0.
